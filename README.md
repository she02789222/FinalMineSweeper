# FinalMineSweeper
- This is my first android project.
- Some part of the code is from: https://github.com/marcellelek/Minesweeper.
- And [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.slab.finalminesweeper) is the published app.
- I am lazy in getter and setter and I don't know much about design pattern, so the architecture of the project seems(actually) very bad.
